These results match Table 1 of Karlan and List (2007), indicating that the treatment was successfully randomized and there are no meaningful pre-treatment differences. import statsmodels.formula.api as smf from scipy.stats import ttest_ind"

    "section": "Experimental Results",
    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\nA barplot comparing the response rates between groups shows that the treatment group had a higher donation rate than the control group.\nA Welch’s t-test confirms this difference is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01), and a bivariate linear regression of ‘gave ~ treatment’ returns a positive and significant coefficient. This matches the finding in Table 2a, Panel A.\nA probit regression, as shown in Table 3 Column 1 of the original study, confirms that being in the treatment group significantly increases the probability of donating. The coefficient on treatment is around 0.325, and statistically significant at the 1% level.\nInterpretation: These results show that offering a matching grant increases the likelihood of donating. People respond not just to financial incentives, but also to social and framing cues that increase perceived impact.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\nUsing t-tests, I find no statistically significant difference in response rates between the 1:1 and 2:1 match groups, nor between 2:1 and 3:1. This supports the authors’ observation that “increasing the match ratio above 1:1 does not further increase the probability that an individual gives.”\nIn a regression of ‘gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3’, the coefficients are not statistically different from each other. Manually computing response rate differences from the data confirms this: the increase from 1:1 to 2:1 is about 0.0003, and from 2:1 to 3:1 is about -0.0002.\nConclusion: Higher match ratios do not significantly increase the probability of giving, confirming that simply including a match matters more than its size.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\nA regression of ‘amount ~ treatment’ shows a small, positive, and statistically significant effect of treatment on donation amount. However, when restricting to individuals who actually donated (‘gave == 1’), the coefficient becomes smaller and statistically insignificant.\nHistograms of donation amounts for the control and treatment groups (among givers only) show similar distributions, with nearly identical sample means.\nInterpretation: The treatment does not affect the size of donations once someone has decided to give. The causal impact lies in encouraging whether someone donates, not how much they give."

    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic “works,” in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\nI simulated 100,000 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 from the treatment distribution. I then computed 10,000 differences and plotted their cumulative average.\nThe plot shows the cumulative average stabilizing around the true difference (0.004), consistent with the Law of Large Numbers: as sample size increases, the sample mean converges to the true mean.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nI ran simulations with sample sizes of 50, 200, 500, and 1000. For each size, I drew 1000 samples and computed the difference in means. The resulting histograms become increasingly normal and concentrated as sample size increases.\nIn small samples, the distribution is wide and skewed. At larger sizes, it becomes bell-shaped and centered near the true difference. Zero clearly moves from being in the middle (in small samples) to being in the tail (in larger samples).\nThis demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem: the sampling distribution of the mean difference becomes approximately normal as sample size increases."
