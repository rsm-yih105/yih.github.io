People respond not just to financial incentives, but also to social and framing cues that increase perceived impact.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\nUsing t-tests, I find no statistically significant difference in response rates between the 1:1 and 2:1 match groups, nor between 2:1 and 3:1. This supports the authors’ observation that “increasing the match ratio above 1:1 does not further increase the probability that an individual gives.”\n\n\n1:1 vs 2:1: TtestResult(statistic=0.0, pvalue=1.0, df=22264.0)\n2:1 vs 3:1: TtestResult(statistic=0.0, pvalue=1.0, df=22264.0)\n\n\nIn a regression of ‘gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3’, the coefficients are not statistically different from each other. Manually computing response rate differences from the data confirms this: the increase from 1:1 to 2:1 is about 0.0003, and from 2:1 to 3:1 is about -0.0002.\n\n\n\nOLS Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

For each size, I drew 1000 samples and computed the difference in means. The resulting histograms become increasingly normal and concentrated as sample size increases.\nIn small samples, the distribution is wide and skewed. At larger sizes, it becomes bell-shaped and centered near the true difference. Zero clearly moves from being in the middle (in small samples) to being in the tail (in larger samples).\nThis demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem: the sampling distribution of the mean difference becomes approximately normal as sample size increases."
