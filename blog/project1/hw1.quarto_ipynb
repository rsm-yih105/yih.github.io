        "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a large-scale **natural field experiment** to test the effectiveness of different fundraising strategies, specifically focusing on the role of **matching grants** in charitable giving. The study was published in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007.\n",
        "\n",
        "To conduct the experiment, they collaborated with a politically liberal nonprofit organization in the United States. They sent direct mail solicitations to **50,083 previous donors**, randomly assigning them to one of several treatment groups:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **control group** that received a standard fundraising letter with no mention of a matching gift.\n",
        "- Several **treatment groups**, which received letters mentioning a **matching grant** from a “concerned fellow member,” with variations in:\n",
        "  - The **match ratio**: $1:$1, $2:$1, or $3:$1.\n",
        "  - The **maximum matching grant amount**: $25,000, $50,000, or $100,000.\n",
        "  - The **suggested donation amount**: three levels relative to the recipient's historical prior contribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each letter was otherwise identical in content and conformed to the nonprofit’s usual style and language. By using real donation requests and real monetary stakes, this experiment goes beyond hypothetical survey-based approaches and offers insight into **actual donor behavior** in a natural setting.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project seeks to replicate their findings using the publicly available data, focusing on the following main outcomes:\n",
        "- The **response rate** (proportion of individuals who donated).\n",
        "- The **revenue per solicitation** (total amount raised divided by number of solicitations).\n",
        "- The effect of **different match ratios** on both response rate and revenue.\n",
        "- Whether **larger match ratios** lead to proportionally greater donations.\n",

        "\n",
        "A probit regression, as shown in Table 3 Column 1 of the original study, confirms that being in the treatment group significantly increases the probability of donating. The coefficient on treatment is around 0.325, and statistically significant at the 1% level.\n",

        "Using t-tests, I find no statistically significant difference in response rates between the 1:1 and 2:1 match groups, nor between 2:1 and 3:1. This supports the authors' observation that \"increasing the match ratio above 1:1 does not further increase the probability that an individual gives.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "In a regression of 'gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3', the coefficients are not statistically different from each other. Manually computing response rate differences from the data confirms this: the increase from 1:1 to 2:1 is about 0.0003, and from 2:1 to 3:1 is about -0.0002.\n",

        "Histograms of donation amounts for the control and treatment groups (among givers only) show similar distributions, with nearly identical sample means.\n",

        "\n",
        "I ran simulations with sample sizes of 50, 200, 500, and 1000. For each size, I drew 1000 samples and computed the difference in means. The resulting histograms become increasingly normal and concentrated as sample size increases.\n",
